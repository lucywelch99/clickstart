			<p style="font-family:courier;">A <mark>conscientious, hardworking, proactive, customer- orientated</mark> young adult who <mark>thrives when working within a great team.</mark> <br><br><mark>Over ten years of excellent customer service experience</mark> within cafe, supermarket, tourist attraction and administration settings, including completing set-up routines and using my creativity to entice customers to the counters as best as I can. <br><br>I am enthusiastic about working with a range of people from whom <mark>I can learn new skills.</mark></p>

			<center> <h2 style="font-family:courier;"><u><b>Why Clickstart</b></u></h1></center>
		
			<p style="font-family:courier;"> I decided to do the Clickstart Programme so that I could <mark>develop new knowledge within UX, UI, Web Development and Digital Marketing.</mark> I completed Graphic Design at GCSE, in which I achieved a 'B', and have been growing more <mark>interest within digital marketing and social media marketing</mark> as I have left education.</p>
		
		<br><br>
		
			<center> <h2 style="font-family:courier;"><u><b>What I Aim To Gain From Clickstart</b></u></h1></center>
		
			<p style="font-family:courier;"> I chose Clickstart because of the <mark>great range of areas</mark> that we would be getting an <mark>insight</mark> into, but also for the aspect of Catch22 who aim to help with our recruitment after the course as there are some areas I believe I could develop further in. The course will hopefully help me to workout what I would like to persue as a career in the near future. </p>
